# Cynaptics Induction Task

With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence, models are becoming increasingly powerful, and their outputs are becoming harder to distinguish from real-world data. This is particularly evident in the field of image generation. Cutting-edge models like **Flux Dev** and **SD3.5** produce such realistic images that differentiating them from genuine ones has become a significant challenge.

## Task Objective

The goal of this competition is to develop a **machine learning algorithm** capable of distinguishing between real and AI-generated images.

## Key Details

- **Compulsory Sub_Task 1**: Participants are free to initiate the task using any algorithm of their choice. It carries 40% weightage during evaluation. The link to the competition is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/induction-task)
- **Compulsory Sub_Task 2**: Implement a **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)** from scratch, for reference a baseline script has been provided. The GAN should be able to generate good images. Browny points if you can somehow use it for image classification task also. It carries 50% weightage during evaluation.
- **Bonus Sub_Task**: Train your GAN to generate some theme based images as a starting point you can train it on christmas theme but you are free to try out other themes also. This carries 10% weightage during evaluation.

## Provided Resources

- **Training Data**: Training data has been provided to support the development of models.
- **Baseline Scripts**:
  - A baseline script for the classification task.
  - A baseline script for GAN implementation.
  - Participants are encouraged to explore, modify, and experiment with these scripts to achieve better results.
