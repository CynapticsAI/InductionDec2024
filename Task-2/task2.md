# Hangman Game

For this task, your goal is to train a machine learning model to play the Hangman game and achieve a high score. Here’s how you can get started:

1.  **Dataset**:
    
    -   We have provided a training dataset and a validation dataset for this task.
    -   You are only allowed to use the training dataset for training the model—no other datasets are permitted.
2.  **Baseline Code**:
    
    -   A well-documented notebook (`hangman.ipynb`) containing the baseline code is provided to help you understand the underlying logic.
    -   Your task is to improve the model's performance by enhancing the provided baseline model.
3.  **Evaluation**:
    
    -   Once you’ve trained your model, run it for 100 games on the validation dataset to evaluate its performance.
4.  **Submission Guidelines**:
    
    -   Submit the `hangman.ipynb` notebook, which should include your enhanced model, training code, and evaluation results.
    -   Also, submit the model weights file as `model_weights.pth`.
